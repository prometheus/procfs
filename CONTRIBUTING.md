Acksin uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* Pull Requests should describe what the patch does and include tests.
    - We prefer patches which are smaller to larger ones.
* Relevant coding style guidelines are the
  [Go Code Review Comments](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
  and the _Formatting and style_ section of Peter Bourgon's
  [Go: Best Practices for Production Environments](http://peter.bourgon.org/go-in-production/#formatting-and-style).
